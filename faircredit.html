		<h2>What is a Credit Report?</h2>
		<p>A Credit report holds crucial information about you, such as information about your identity, your professional and personal addresses, and other pertinent information. A credit report is used by a creditor to decide whether or not to extend a credit to you. Information such as your bill-paying habits and your credit history come into play when taking such a decision. Your credit report is created by credit reporting agencies or bureaus which send it to businesses for evaluation.</p>
	  	<h3>Why a Law?</h3>
	  <p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act is a federal law that regulates credit reporting companies. The purpose of the act is to ensure “accuracy and fairness of credit reporting.” A lot of things, including the banking system, a debtor’s credit worthiness and capacity, consumer privacy, and creditor decisions on general consumer reputations are dependent on this Act.</p>
	  <h3>How Does This Law Benefit?</h3>
	 <p>These consumer reporting agencies disperse information if or when required by court order, requested by the individual consumer. The information can also be requested by a creditor or some other entity who may want to learn about the credit worthiness of a particular debtor; either with the intent of lending a debt, employment or setting up some type of a business relationship.
File Consumer Bankruptcy

The debtor has the right to ask for a copy of their credit report at any point of time. This can be done by mail or phone. </p>
	 <h3>What is Fair Credit Reporting Act?</h3>
	 <p>“The purpose of this [act] is to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this [act].”</p>
	 <p>The primary purpose of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is to ensure fairness and accuracy of credit reporting, and that the procedures followed are reasonable.</p>
